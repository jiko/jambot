            <p>This is a twitter bot based on <a href="https://github.com/jiko/Markov-Sentence-Generator">Markov-Sentence-Generator</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jiko/the_shrinkbot">the_shrinkbot</a>. Shout-outs to <a href="https://github.com/hrs">Harry Schwartz</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vivekhaldar">Vivek Haldar</a>, and Kevin Dalton.</p>

            <p>There is a Google Doc listing <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gd79hhSKXYAsstW3hQ5eP9vqIrcliFIlmj4UoxgOYfw/edit?pli=1">the works included in corpus.txt</a>.</p>

            <h2>Choice Tweets</h2>
            <p>These tweets were generated by this script running automatically every day at 3:14 am and 3:14 pm. The script is written in Python, based on code from <a href="http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/2830035130/how-to-write-a-twitter-bot-in-python">Vivek Haldar</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hrs/Markov-Sentence-Generator">Harry Schwartz</a>. The script uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chain</a> to make a statistical model of a given corpus. The tweets featured below were generated from my suriving corpus: everything that I have written that survives in an electronic format. The model is based on what words tend to follow what other words. Then the script uses this model to generate a sentence which it then tweets. Voil√†.</p>
