JAMBOT
======

Notice: I have not tested the Twitter-related code since the change to API v1.1.

This is a twitter bot based on [Markov-Sentence-Generator](https://github.com/jiko/Markov-Sentence-Generator) and [the_shrinkbot](https://github.com/jiko/the_shrinkbot). Shout-outs to [Harry Schwartz](https://github.com/hrs), [Vivek Haldar](https://github.com/vivekhaldar), and Kevin Dalton.

There is a Google Doc listing [the works included in corpus.txt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gd79hhSKXYAsstW3hQ5eP9vqIrcliFIlmj4UoxgOYfw/edit?pli=1).

Requires the 'twitter' pypi package: pip install twitter

See init_twit.py for info on setting up your Twitter application.

For the story of this project's inception, see my essay "[Programmatic Text Generation and Me](http://jameskoppen.com/spamdada.html)".
